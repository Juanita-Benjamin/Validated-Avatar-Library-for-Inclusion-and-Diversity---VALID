All avatars have embedded textures and materials. Unity usually does not extract them automatically. Below are instructions on importing and animating sample avatars

1. Import the avatar into your Assets folder
2. Using the Inspector, go to the "Materials" tab of the asset's Import Settings 
3. Click "Extract textures" and "Extract Materials"
4. Go to the"Rig" tab of the asset's Import Settings
5. Select Animation Type: Humanoid 
6. Select "Create From This Model" 

Avatars should now be ready to animate.
